	<b>Here, the violin is taken as a real tool for happiness. 
	 It involves a strong comparison, which tells us that music 
	 (and, in this case, the violin and  the practice of this instrument) 
	 leads to joy and happiness, through hard work. 
	 	So one must not get discouraged, but instead keep working, 
	 to hopefully one day reach this 
     nirvana...!!</b></pre>
